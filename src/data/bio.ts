    "DARK MATTER launched their project at the start of 2024, immediately gaining momentum by winning the Circus Records remix contest for Flux Pavilion and Conrank's \"Where You At.\" Since then, they've remained relentless in their pursuit of sonic innovation, delivering boundary-pushing music that defies classification.",
    
    "In November 2025, DARK MATTER made their Wakaan debut with their Awakening EP, marking a pivotal moment for the project. Their music has been supported heavily by Liquid Stranger throughout his 2025 Revolution Tour and featured at major festivals including Wakaan Festival, EDC Las Vegas, Bass Canyon, Electric Forest, Rampage Open Air, and Force Fields. Their remix of \"Supersonic\" by DirtySnatcha and Carbin has also earned major DJ support, played out by Zeds Dead and Japanese producer Alan Shirahama.",
